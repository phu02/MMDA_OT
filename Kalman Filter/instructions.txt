1. the data coming from Yun to server should be 2 channels of data, each with three columns. 1 channel for accel x,y,z info; the other channel for gyro roll pitch yaw information.

2. Data from server to iPhone should still be of the same form:
	n rows x 3 columns 	for both accel and gyro data

3. detection algorithms are in viewController.swift
	for toothbrushing, it's function TestButton
	for hairbrushing, it's function Trigger_draw.

4. you can call the function by running the simulation, and click the button trigger.

5. You also need to include my modified ABMatrix.swift and KalmanFilter.swift in your code. BTW, kalman filter is actually not working. We've worked around it.
